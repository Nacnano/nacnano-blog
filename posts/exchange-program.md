**Disclaimer: This paragraph is for applying for UGRAD Scholarship Program.**

In my neighborhood, helping out isn't just something we do; it's how we live. I'm really into this, and my time as a student and leader has been all about caring for my community. I'm all about making positive changes and seeing other people happy, and I think I'd be a great fit for the Global UGRAD Program.

I show my commitment to helping out by joining in on different local events. I've volunteered in things like the local campaign against mosquitoes and pitching in at yard sales in a nearby hospital. Doing these things let me make a difference in my community, and seeing the smiles and thanks from the people I helped keeps me wanting to do more.

At school, I've taken on roles that are all about bringing students together. I've been the head of the school's International Chess Club and in charge of the Information Department for the school Yearbook Committee. I put together events not just to make school life better for students but also to create fun times and friendships.

I also put effort into organizing tech-related events. My goal isn't just to share what I know but to get others excited about technology and coming up with new ideas. Seeing younger students light up with curiosity and joy when they discover something new is something that makes me happy.

When I've helped out in different school events, like the School Open House for the math and computer department and the School Introductory Camp, I've tried to make learning more than just a task. I believe education works best when it's enjoyable and brings a sense of fulfillment.

Outside my community, I made a Science learning tool for junior students. I wanted to show how learning can be interesting and easy to get into. Seeing the younger students get excited and curious about learning has made me believe even more in how education can change lives and make people happy.

"I love seeing other people happy" isn't just a thought for me; it's a way I guide my actions. This is what keeps me committed to helping and leading. The UGRAD Program lines up perfectly with what I believe in, giving me a chance to explore new things, connect with different communities, and add to the happiness and well-being of others.

Besides, being good in English and able to adapt easily, I'm ready to do well in a setting with people from various cultures. I'm not just about helping out in my community; I also want to encourage global understanding and teamwork, thinking that joy is something that everyone shares no matter where they're from.

To sum it up, my experiences as a leader and someone who helps out in my community, combined with my love for technology and innovation, make me an ideal person for the Global UGRAD Program. I'm excited to bring my way of looking at things, really add to the program, and, when I'm back, keep making positive changes and inspire others in my community, all while enjoying the happiness that comes from seeing others happy.
